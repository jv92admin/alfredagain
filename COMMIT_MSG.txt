V3: Entity lifecycle, step type taxonomy, and layered prompt architecture

ARCHITECTURE CHANGES:
- Add Understand node for entity state management and clarification detection
- Implement 3-state entity lifecycle (PENDING/ACTIVE/INACTIVE) with garbage collection
- Replace 'crud' step type with read/write/analyze/generate taxonomy
- Add group-based parallelization (steps with same group can run in parallel)
- Implement step-type-specific Act prompt injection (prompts/act/*.md)

NEW MODULES:
- src/alfred/core/ - Entity and Mode management
- src/alfred/prompts/ - Injection, personas, examples
- src/alfred/observability/session_logger.py - JSONL session logging
- docs/decision_architecture.md - Decision point reference

KEY FIXES:
- Ghost entity prevention (only db_read/db_write promote to active_entities)
- Summarize deterministically handles proposals vs completions
- Reply distinguishes generated vs saved content
- Act duplicate query detection prevents infinite loops
- Think prompt prevents over-planning (e.g., unrequested shopping lists)
- UUID field sanitization (empty string -> None)
- Archive section now injected for all step types

PROMPT UPDATES:
- prompts/understand.md - New node prompt
- prompts/think.md - Refactored for step types, batch reads, accurate counts
- prompts/act/base.md - Core mechanics with exit contract
- prompts/act/read.md, write.md, analyze.md, generate.md - Type-specific rules
- prompts/reply.md - Generated vs saved distinction
- prompts/summarize.md - Contract definition
