 You: i want to update the vibe frrom more vegetabels to - using chicken cod paneer chickpeas and eggs as primary protein. spicy food; curies; acid and zesty food
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
Alfred: Got it! I've updated your cooking vibe to focus on chicken, cod, paneer, chickpeas, and eggs as your primary proteins, with an emphasis on spicy foods, curries, and acid/zesty flavors. This will help tailor recipe 
suggestions and meal plans to your new preferences. Ready to find some recipes or plan meals with this fresh vibe?

----------------- NEXT TURN -----------------
 You: thanks. now look at the ingredients i have, can you design a meal plan for me for jan 5 - jan 10? i want 8 meals for lunces adn dinners (you can leav e2 spots emptyf or takeout). i am happy to use leftovers once (reheat once).
 lets deisgn recipes first - confirm them, then add them to the meal plan?

Alfred: Here's my plan: I'll review your current inventory and preferences, then design 6 original recipes using your preferred proteins (chicken, cod, paneer, chickpeas, eggs) and flavor profile (spicy, curries, acid/zesty). I'll 
ensure these recipes fit your equipment and skill level, and avoid your allergies. You'll review and confirm the recipes first. After confirmation, I'll add them to a meal plan for Jan 5-10, filling 8 lunch/dinner slots (leaving 2  
for takeout) and allowing each recipe to be used twice (once as leftovers). Sound good?

Sound good? (You can confirm, adjust, or tell me more details.)

----------------- NEXT TURN -----------------
 You: yup sounds like a plan. lets use 4 recipes not 6 though.

setting up batch cooking tasks for Sunday and Wednesday just yet.

Here’s what we can do next: I can help you save the missing recipes first, then proceed with saving the meal plan, adding needed items to your shopping list, and creating those batch cooking tasks. Would you like me to start by
